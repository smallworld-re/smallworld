class AngrEmulator(emulator.Emulator):
    """
    Superclass for angr-based emulators.

    This is primarily designed to support symbolic execution,
    although subclasses can configure angr however they like.

    One challenge with symbolic execution is that
    it doesn't work on a single machine state,
    but rather multiple machine states representing
    parallel execution paths.

    As such, this interface doesn't yet fully support
    all features of the base Emulator class;
    it's not clear what reading or writing machine state
    means when there's more than one state.
