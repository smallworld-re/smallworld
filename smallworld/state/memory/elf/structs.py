    Lief parses this data, but I can't keep the objects around.

    This adds one field to the typical ELF symbol, baseaddr.
    ELF symbol values are often relative,
    but relative to what is an annoying question:

    - In non-PIC binaries, the value is relative to zero.
    - In linked PIC binaries, the value is relative to the load address
    - In relocatables (.o and .ko), the value is relative to the section's address

    I'll figure out the base address; to get the absolute address,
    just add value to baseaddr.

    This also adds a data structure helper field, relas,
    so I can collect the relas linked to a symbol
    without a separate dict.
