## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `Memory` state objects with large values are now stringified much faster.

### Added

- `Filter` analyses that simply listen to the hint stream.
- `Instruction` classes that provide information on instruction semantics, with
  methods for capturing concrete values.
- `Value.type` for storing optional type information.
- `Value.label` for storing optional label information.
- `Emulator.hook()` for dynamic hooking.
- `state.models` a collection of python models for library code implemented as
  customizable hooks.
- `Emulator.hook()` for dynamic hooking.
- `CodeReachable` analysis that shows what code is reachable by symbolic execution.
- `PointerFinder` analysis that finds pointers
- `state.debug` a collection of debug utilities that can be mapped into state.
- `fuzz()` AFL Unicorn fuzzing harness utility.
- `AngrEmulator` based on angr symbolic execution.
- `ELFImage` state object that loads an ELF file.
- `AngrNWBTAnalysis` unused value analysis using angr.
- `ControlFlowTracer` analysis that logs all jumps, calls, and returns.
- `CodeCoverage` analysis that maps program counter to hit count.
- `CodeReachable` analysis that show what code is reachable by symbolic execution.

### Changed

- `Value.{get, set}()` changed to `@property` `value`.
- `UnicornEmulator` captures more detailed error information in single step
  mode.
- `UnicornEmulator.write_memory()` now supports overlapping writes and no
  longer requires addresses to be page aligned.
- `Code.exits` changed to `Code.bounds` - ranges of valid execution rather than
  fixed exit points.
- `State.map()` automatically selects names for mapped objects when not
  provided.
